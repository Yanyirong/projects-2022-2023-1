# projects-2022-2023-1

This project includes some of the homeworks or projects I have done at 
the first semester of my junior year in SJTU.

Mainly includes four courses:

+ Computer Vision
+ Natural Language Processing
+ Brain-Inspired Computing
+ Deep Learning
+ Chip Design

If you are a student major in AI in SJTU, you can refer to these projects, which can help you save some time.

But ATTENTION, please do not copy my code directly.You can get some idea from my code, but you should write your own code and finish your own homework.

## Computer Vision
Computer Vision has two homeworks,you can find them in the CV_HW1 and CV_HW2 folder.

## Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing has three homeworks,you can find them in the ngram,hmm_bpe and w2v folder.

## Brain-Inspired Computing
The folder named brain_inspired_computing includes the homeworks and the final project.

Check the folder and get more details.

## Deep Learning
In dl_hw folder,you can find the small projects of Deep Learning.

In dl_final folder,you can find the final project of Deep Learning.

Check the folder and get more details.

## Chip Design
In chip_lab folder,you can find the a small project of Chip Design.

This maybe useless but I still upload it because I thinlk it is interesting.
